## Unit 1: Getting Started with the GNOME Graphical Desktop
There are many available graphical applications to the gnome desktop.
Here are the what you'll need to get familiar with:

* Terminal
* Text Editor
* File browser

### `gedit` (Gnome Edit)

	$ gedit

or supply the file(s) after the command. This filenames can be
existing files or files that will be created after *Save* or hitting `Ctrl+S`

	$ gedit file.txt
	
The gnome editor is also accessible via the Main Menu.

## Unit 4: Manage Physical Storage

## Unit 5: Manage System Resources
What to monitor:

* CPU power
* Bandwidth
* Memory
* Storage


1. free. The free command displays system memory utilization.

2. top. The top command displays pretty much everything. CPU utilization, process statistics, memory utilization â€” top monitors it all. In addition, unlike the free command, top's default behavior is to run continuously; there is no need to use the watch command.

3. The GNOME System Monitor. If you are more comfortable with graphical user interfaces, the GNOME System Monitor may be more to your liking. Like top, the GNOME System Monitor displays information related to overall system status, process counts, memory and swap utilization, and process-level statistics.

However, the GNOME System Monitor goes a step further by also including graphical representations of CPU, memory, and swap utilization, along with a tabular disk space utilization listing.
